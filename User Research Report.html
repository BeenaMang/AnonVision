<!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>This research study examined the privacy protection needs and current workflows of content creators, journalists, educators, and researchers who regularly work with photographs containing identifiable individuals. Through semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiry with six participants at Iowa State University, we identified critical pain points in current face anonymization workflows and validated the need for AnonVision, a streamlined privacy protection tool.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<p><strong>Critical Pain Points Identified:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Extreme time consumption: participants spend 15-45 minutes per image using manual editing methods</li>
    <li>Software barriers: 67% lack access to professional image editing software; those with access struggle with steep learning curves</li>
    <li>Inconsistent results: manual processes lead to uneven privacy protection and missed faces</li>
    <li>Privacy anxiety: all participants expressed concern about accidentally publishing unprotected identities</li>
    <li>Batch processing limitations: no efficient way to process multiple images simultaneously</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Primary User Needs:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Simplicity: 100% of participants want a solution "as easy as saving a file"</li>
    <li>Speed: must process images in under 1 minute each</li>
    <li>Preview capability: 83% need to see results before saving</li>
    <li>Local processing: all 6 participants require privacy-preserving local processing without cloud uploads</li>
    <li>Affordability: must be free or very low cost</li>
</ul>

<!-- RESEARCH METHODOLOGY -->
<h1>Research Methodology</h1>

<h2>Study Design</h2>

<p>This qualitative research study employed multiple methods to gain deep insights into user needs, behaviors, and pain points related to face anonymization in photographs. The study was conducted over two weeks in September 2025.</p>

<h2>Participant Recruitment</h2>

<p>Participants were recruited through purposive sampling from various academic departments. Recruitment criteria included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Regular work with photographs containing identifiable individuals</li>
    <li>Current or past need to protect identities in images</li>
    <li>Diverse roles (students, faculty, staff) to capture varied perspectives</li>
    <li>Different levels of technical proficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants were recruited via in person meeting within their departments</p>

<h2>Research Methods</h2>

<p>The study employed multiple qualitative research methods:</p>

<h3>1. Semi-Structured Interviews (45 minutes each)</h3>
<p>Individual interviews were conducted to explore participants' experiences, needs, and frustrations with face anonymization. The interview protocol included open-ended questions about current workflows, pain points, and ideal solutions.</p>

<h3>2. Contextual Inquiry</h3>
<p>Participants demonstrated their current anonymization process using their own tools and recent projects. This revealed workflow details, tool usage patterns, and hidden inefficiencies not typically captured through interviews alone.</p>

<h3>3. Task Analysis</h3>
<p>We documented step-by-step processes participants currently use, timing each stage to quantify efficiency issues.</p>

<h3>4. Pain Point Mapping</h3>
<p>Throughout interviews, we systematically identified and categorized frustrations, obstacles, and unmet needs.</p>

<h2>Interview Protocol</h2>

<p>The following questions guided our semi-structured interviews:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Can you describe a recent situation where you needed to protect identities in photographs?</li>
    <li>Walk me through your current process for anonymizing faces, step by step.</li>
    <li>What tools do you currently use? What works well about them?</li>
    <li>What frustrates you most about your current approach?</li>
    <li>How do you decide what level of anonymization is appropriate for different contexts?</li>
    <li>How many images do you typically need to process at once?</li>
    <li>How much time does this process typically take you?</li>
    <li>Have you ever had concerns about privacy protection being inadequate?</li>
    <li>What would your ideal privacy protection tool look like?</li>
    <li>Are there features you wish existed but don't currently?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>

<p>Interview recordings were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. We employed affinity diagramming to synthesize findings, grouping similar observations into themes. Journey mapping was used to visualize current workflows and identify opportunity areas for improvement.</p>

<!-- KEY FINDINGS -->
<h1>Key Findings</h1>

<h2>Critical Pain Points</h2>

<p>Through our research, five major pain points emerged consistently across all participants:</p>

<div class="finding-box">
    <h3>Pain Point 1: Extreme Time Consumption</h3>
    <p>All six participants reported spending between 15-45 minutes per image using their current manual methods. This time investment compounds dramatically with multiple images.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"Last observation period I took 150 photos. It took me three weeks of evenings just to process them all. That's not research time—that's just tedious manual labor." - P4</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"I have to do each photo one by one. Last event I had 47 photos to edit. I spent my entire weekend on it." - P5</p>
    
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Time spent on manual editing directly reduces time available for core responsibilities (research, writing, teaching). Two participants (P2, P4) reported missing deadlines specifically due to photo processing delays.</p>
</div>

<div class="finding-box">
    <h3>Pain Point 2: Inconsistent Results and Quality Concerns</h3>
    <p>Manual processes led to uneven results, with participants expressing low confidence in the consistency and professionalism of their output.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"Sometimes I blur too much and lose context, other times not enough and you can still recognize people. There's no standard." - P2</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"I feel like I'm back in kindergarten using Paint. It's embarrassing how unprofessional my photos look." - P1 (Emily)</p>
    
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Inconsistent anonymization creates legal/ethical risks. Unprofessional appearance damages credibility of published work. Participants often over-blur to compensate for uncertainty, losing valuable contextual information.</p>
</div>

<div class="finding-box">
    <h3>Pain Point 3: Software Access and Technical Barriers</h3>
    <p>67% of participants (4 of 6) lack access to professional image editing software. Those with access struggle with steep learning curves and complex interfaces.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"Our department can't afford Photoshop licenses for everyone. I'm left using whatever free tool I can find online." - P3</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"I watched three YouTube tutorials and still can't figure out layers in GIMP. I just want to blur faces—why is this so complicated?" - P1</p>
    
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Software barriers force users toward inadequate solutions (Paint, PowerPoint) or create dependencies on limited computer lab access. Learning curves prevent adoption of better tools even when available.</p>
</div>

<div class="finding-box">
    <h3>Pain Point 4: Privacy Anxiety and Compliance Concerns</h3>
    <p>All participants expressed significant anxiety about potentially publishing images with inadequately protected identities. Academic participants face additional IRB and FERPA compliance requirements.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"I lie awake at night worrying I missed someone's face. One mistake could end my journalism career." - P2 </p>
    
    <p class="quote">"IRB requires documented proof that we've properly anonymized participants. With manual methods, how can I prove I didn't miss anyone?" - P3</p>
    
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Privacy anxiety causes stress and risk-averse behavior. Some participants avoid using photos entirely despite their value. Manual detection is error-prone, creating genuine compliance risks.</p>
</div>

<div class="finding-box">
    <h3>Pain Point 5: No Efficient Batch Processing</h3>
    <p>67% of participants regularly need to process multiple images but lack efficient batch processing capabilities.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"I have to open each photo individually, do the editing, save it with a new name, and move to the next one. With 40+ photos, it's soul-crushing repetition." - P5 </p>
    
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Repetitive work causes physical fatigue (eye strain, repetitive stress). Batch needs go unmet, limiting use of photo documentation. Creates bottleneck in research and publication workflows.</p>

<!-- DESIGN REQUIREMENTS -->
<h1>Design Requirements</h1>

<p>Based on our research findings, affinity analysis, and journey mapping, we have identified the following design requirements for AnonVision, prioritized using the MoSCoW method:</p>

<h2>Must Have (P0) - Critical for MVP</h2>

<div class="insight-box">

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Automatic face detection</strong></td>
            <td>Manual face selection is the primary cause of time consumption and errors. Automated detection addresses core pain point.</td>
            <td>100% of participants manually select faces; average 3-5 min per photo just for selection</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>One-click processing</strong></td>
            <td>Users demand simplicity equivalent to "opening and saving a file" with minimal configuration.</td>
            <td>100% requested "one-click" or equivalent simplicity</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Blur and pixelate options</strong></td>
            <td>Different contexts require different anonymization styles. Blur preferred for general use, pixelate for stronger protection.</td>
            <td>83% want choice between methods</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Adjustable privacy levels</strong></td>
            <td>Single privacy level insufficient for diverse use cases (classroom vs. protest, minors vs. adults).</td>
            <td>100% need variable privacy strength; contexts vary significantly</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Real-time preview</strong></td>
            <td>Users need to verify appropriateness before saving; "see before you save" is critical for confidence.</td>
            <td>83% require preview capability</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Local processing only</strong></td>
            <td>Research ethics, FERPA, and IRB compliance require no cloud uploads. Privacy is non-negotiable.</td>
            <td>100% require local processing; several have institutional prohibitions on cloud use</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Simple GUI interface</strong></td>
            <td>Command-line interface would exclude primary user base; technical barriers already major pain point.</td>
            <td>67% lack technical proficiency; all want GUI</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Processing speed <60 sec/image</strong></td>
            <td>Current 15-45 min/image is unsustainable. Sub-minute processing enables practical adoption.</td>
            <td>All participants cite time as critical factor</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<h2>Should Have (P1) - Important for User Satisfaction</h2>

</div>

<h2>Could Have (P2) - Nice to Have Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Comparison grid output:</strong> Shows all anonymization options side-by-side for evaluation</li>
    <li><strong>Drag-and-drop interface:</strong> Alternative to file dialog for improved UX</li>
    <li><strong>Undo functionality:</strong> Allows experimentation without consequences</li>
    <li><strong>Custom output directory:</strong> User control over save location</li>
    <li><strong>Processing history log:</strong> Documentation for compliance purposes (IRB)</li>
    <li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts:</strong> Power user efficiency improvements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Won't Have (P3) - Out of Scope for Initial Version</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Video processing:</strong> Significantly more complex; focus on images first (noted in original spec as deferred)</li>
    <li><strong>Selective face protection:</strong> Ability to protect only specific individuals; adds UI complexity</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud storage integration:</strong> Contradicts privacy requirement</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced editing features:</strong> Would replicate Photoshop; contradicts simplicity goal</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile app version:</strong> Desktop focus for initial version</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk Mitigation Strategies</h2>

<div class="finding-box">
    <h3>Risk: Inconsistent Face Detection Across Conditions</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Haar Cascade may struggle with profile views, occlusions, poor lighting, or non-frontal faces.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Users lose confidence; defeats core value proposition of automatic detection.</p>
    <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin: 5pt 0 0 20pt;">
        <li>Implement multi-angle Haar Cascade classifiers (frontal, profile)</li>
        <li>Develop fallback to DNN-based detector for images with <3 faces detected</li>
        <li>Add visual detection boxes so users can verify before saving</li>
        <li>Include "Add Manual Detection" feature for missed faces (Phase 3)</li>
        <li>Set clear expectations: "Works best with frontal faces in good lighting"</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="finding-box">
    <h3>Risk: Performance Issues with Large Images or Batches</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> High-resolution images or large batches may cause slow processing or memory issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> User frustration; fails to meet <60 sec target.</p>
    <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>

        <li>Set reasonable limits with clear messaging (e.g., "Batch limit: 100 images")</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="finding-box">
    <h3>Risk: User Expectations Exceed MVP Capabilities</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Users may expect video processing, selective anonymization, or advanced features.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Disappointment despite meeting stated requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin: 5pt 0 0 20pt;">
        <li>Clear product positioning: "Simple, fast face blurring for images"</li>

        <li>Focus user testing on stated capabilities</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>User Testing Plan</h2>

<p>Upon completion of Phase 2, conduct user acceptance testing with 3-4 research participants:</p>

<h3>Testing Protocol</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Pre-test:</strong> Brief participants on changes since initial research; set expectations</li>
    <li><strong>Task Scenarios:</strong> Ask participants to complete realistic tasks:
        <ul>
            <li>Process single image from their own work</li>
            <li>Process batch of 5-10 images</li>
            <li>Adjust privacy settings and compare results</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Think-Aloud Protocol:</strong> Ask users to verbalize thoughts during use</li>
    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Note confusion points, errors, and workflow breaks</li>
    <li><strong>Post-test Interview:</strong> Gather qualitative feedback
        <ul>
            <li>What worked well?</li>
            <li>What was confusing or frustrating?</li>
            <li>Would you use this in your real work? Why/why not?</li>
            <li>What features are missing?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Quantitative Survey:</strong> System Usability Scale (SUS) and custom questions</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Video Processing:</strong> Originally planned feature; high user demand from journalism participants</li>
    <li><strong>Selective Face Protection:</strong> Ability to anonymize only specific individuals (e.g., protect minors only)</li>
    <li><strong>Integration with IRB Documentation:</strong> Generate reports showing all processed images for compliance</li>
    <li><strong>Batch Presets:</strong> Save and reuse settings for consistent processing across projects</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Detection Options:</strong> Toggle between Haar Cascade and DNN detectors</li>
    <li><strong>Export Options:</strong> Resolution control, format conversion, compression settings</li>
    <li><strong>Undo/Redo:</strong> Non-destructive editing workflow</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison Mode:</strong> Side-by-side before/after view</li>
</ul>

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>This user research study has validated a significant unmet need for face anonymization technology among journalists, educators, and researchers. All six participants currently employ time-consuming manual methods that create workflow bottlenecks, produce inconsistent results, and generate anxiety about privacy compliance.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<div style="background: #f0fdf4; border: 2px solid #16a34a; padding: 15pt; margin: 15pt 0;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;">The Value Proposition is Clear</p>
    <p>AnonVision can reduce face anonymization time from 15-45 minutes per image to under 60 seconds—a <strong>95%+ time savings</strong>. For users like P4 who process 150 images per research session, this represents savings of <strong>37-112 hours per session</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #eff6ff; border: 2px solid #3b82f6; padding: 15pt; margin: 15pt 0;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;">User Needs are Well-Defined</p>
    <p>Through affinity diagramming and journey mapping, we've identified clear, actionable requirements. The must-have features (automatic detection, one-click processing, real-time preview, local processing) address the core pain points identified across all participants.</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #fef3c7; border: 2px solid #f59e0b; padding: 15pt; margin: 15pt 0;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;">Market Potential Exists</p>
    <p>Participants represent diverse use cases across academic, journalistic, and institutional contexts. The tool addresses universal needs in any field requiring ethical photo documentation. Natural advocacy potential is high—users explicitly stated they would recommend to colleagues.</p>
</div>

<h2>Research Confidence</h2>

<p>This research provides a strong foundation for development. The combination of semi-structured interviews, contextual inquiry, and task analysis gave us both breadth and depth of understanding. Affinity diagramming revealed consistent themes across all participants, and journey mapping identified specific intervention points where AnonVision creates value.</p>

<p>The 75% implementation confidence stated in the original technical specification appears well-justified. The core requirements are technically feasible with OpenCV and NumPy, and the modular architecture allows iterative development and testing.</p>

<h2>Critical Success Factor</h2>

<p>The single most important factor for AnonVision's success is <strong>reliable face detection</strong>. If the system fails to detect faces consistently, the entire value proposition collapses. This must be the primary focus during development, with robust testing across diverse image conditions (lighting, angles, occlusions, skin tones, etc.).</p>

<h2>Final Recommendation</h2>

<p><strong>Proceed with development.</strong> User needs are validated, requirements are clear, and the technical approach is sound. The research demonstrates both demand and feasibility. Focus initial development on the core use case (single image, automatic detection, simple blur) before expanding to batch processing and advanced features. Maintain close contact with research participants for iterative feedback during development.</p>
